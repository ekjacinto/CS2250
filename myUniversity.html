        Out of all the universities I got accepted to into (UCI and CSULB), I

      <ol>
        <li>
          I got accepted into Cal Poly Pomona for Computer Science! Compared to
          other universities, CSULB's Computer Science program is pretty mid and
          UCI is too expensive for tuition and housing
          <ul>
            <li>
              Note: I got into UCI for Aerospace Engineering as a secondary
              major
              <br />
              Even if the cost to attend wasn't as expensive as it currently is,
              I wouldn't have went to UCI for Aerospace Engineering
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          The Computer Science program here is pretty good
          <ul>
            <li>
              Before entering this university, I heard that Cal Poly Pomona had
              a relatively hands-on Computer Science program instead of a much
              more theoretical focus (Stanford and UC Berkeley)
            </li>
            <li>
              As a result, I thought that going to this university would help
              better me in my career path as a future software engineer!
            </li>
          </ul>

          />
          <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
          There were many social opportunities for students living on campus
          (the dorm life)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Having lived on campus my first year, I enjoyed the residental
              halls! Living on the second highest floor felt like I was in
              living in a luxury hotel.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition, the dorming community was great and I got to know a
              lot of people from the many social gatherings on each floor,
              including many other students in this class!
            </li>
          </ul>

        Overall, Cal Poly Pomona has provided me with a great experience both
        academically and socially!
